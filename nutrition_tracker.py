# A Personalized Evidence-Based Nutrition Tracker for Goal-Specific Meal Planning
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

"""
This script implements an interactive, evidence-based nutrition tracker using
Streamlit. It is designed to help users achieve personalized nutrition goals,
such as weight loss, maintenance, or gain, with a focus on vegetarian food
sources.

Core Functionality and Scientific Basis:
- Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) Calculation: The application uses the Mifflin-St
  Jeor equation, which is widely recognized by organizations like the Academy
  of Nutrition and Dietetics for its accuracy.
  - For Males: BMR = (10 * weight_kg) + (6.25 * height_cm) - (5 * age) + 5
  - For Females: BMR = (10 * weight_kg) + (6.25 * height_cm) - (5 * age) - 161

- Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE): The BMR is multiplied by a
  scientifically validated activity factor to estimate the total number of
  calories burned in a day, including physical activity.

- Goal-Specific Caloric Adjustments:
  - Weight Loss: A conservative 20 percent caloric deficit from TDEE.
  - Weight Maintenance: Caloric intake is set equal to TDEE.
  - Weight Gain: A controlled 10 percent caloric surplus over TDEE.

- Macronutrient Strategy: The script follows a protein-first approach,
  consistent with modern nutrition science.
  1. Protein intake is determined based on grams per kilogram of body weight.
  2. Fat intake is set as a percentage of total daily calories.
  3. Carbohydrate intake is calculated from the remaining caloric budget.

Implementation Details:
- The user interface is built with Streamlit, providing interactive widgets
  for user input and data visualization.
- The food database is managed using the Pandas library.
- Progress visualizations are created with Streamlit's native components and
  Plotly for generating detailed charts.

Usage Documentation:
1. Prerequisites: Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed.
   You can install them using pip:
   pip install streamlit pandas plotly

2. Running the Application: Save this script as a Python file (for example,
   `nutrition_app.py`) and run it from your terminal using the following
   command:
   streamlit run nutrition_app.py

3. Interacting with the Application:
   - Use the sidebar to enter your personal details, such as age, height,
     weight, sex, activity level, and primary nutrition goal.
   - Your personalized daily targets for calories and macronutrients will be
     calculated and displayed automatically.
   - Navigate through the food tabs to select the number of servings for
     each food item you consume.
   - The daily summary section will update in real time to show your
     progress toward your targets.

    ### üíß Master Your Hydration Game:
    - **Daily Goal:** Shot for about 35 ml per kilogram of your body weight daily. 
    - **Training Bonus:** Tack on an extra 500-750 ml per hour of sweat time.
    - **Fat Loss Hack:** Chugging 500 ml of water before meals can boost fullness by by 13%. Your stomach will thank you, and so will your waistline.

    ### üò¥ Sleep Like Your Goals Depend on It:
    - **The Shocking Truth:** Getting less than 7 hours of sleep can torpedo your fat loss by a more than half.
    - **Daily Goal:** Shoot for 7-9 hours and try to keep a consistent schedule.
    - **Set the Scene:** Keep your cave dark, cool (18-20¬∞C), and screen-free for at least an hour before lights out.

    ### üìÖ Follow Your Wins:
    - **Morning Ritual:** Weigh yourself first thing after using the bathroom, before eating or drinking, in minimal clothing.
    - **Look for Trends, Not Blips:** Watch your weekly average instead of getting hung up on daily fluctuations. Your weight can swing 2-3 pounds daily. 
    - **Hold the Line:** Don‚Äôt tweak your plan too soon. Wait for two or more weeks of stalled progress before making changes.

    ### Go Beyond the Scale üì∏
    - **The Bigger Picture:** Snap a few pics every month. Use the same pose, lighting, and time of day. The mirror doesn't lie.
    - **Size Up Your Wins:** Measure your waist, hips, arms, and thighs monthly.
    - **The Quiet Victories:** Pay attention to how you feel. Your energy levels, sleep quality, gym performance, and hunger patterns tell a story numbers can‚Äôt.

    ### Mindset Is Everything üß†
    The 80/20 principle is your best defense against the perfectionist trap. It's about ditching that mindset that makes you throw in the towel after one "bad" meal. Instead of trying to master everything at once, build your habits gradually and you‚Äôll be far more likely to stick with them for the long haul.

    #### Start Small, Win Big:
    - **Weeks 1‚Äì2:** Your only job is to focus on hitting your calorie targets. Don‚Äôt worry about anything else!
    - **Weeks 3‚Äì4:** Once calories feel like second nature, start layering in protein tracking.
    - **Week 5 and Beyond:** With calories and protein in the bag, you can now fine-tune your carb and fat intake.

with tab3:
    st.subheader("When Progress Stalls üîÑ")
    st.markdown("""
    ### Hit a Weight Loss Plateau?
    - **Guess Less, Stress Less:** Before you do anything else, double-check how accurately you‚Äôre logging your food. Little things can add up!
    - **Activity Audit:** Take a fresh look at your activity level. Has it shifted?
    - **Walk it Off:** Try adding 10-15 minutes of walking to your daily routine before cutting calories further. It‚Äôs a simple way to boost progress without tightening the belt just yet.
    - **Step Back to Leap Forward:** Consider a "diet break" every 6-8 weeks. Eating at your maintenance calories for a week or two can give your metabolism and your mind a well-deserved reset.
    - **Leaf Your Hunger Behind:** Load your plate with low-calorie, high-volume foods like leafy greens, cucumbers, and berries. They‚Äôre light on calories but big on satisfaction.

    ### Struggling to Gain Weight?
    - **Drink Your Calories:** Liquid calories from smoothies, milk, and protein shakes go down way easier than another full meal.
    - **Fat is Fuel:** Load up healthy fats like nuts, oils, and avocados. 
    - **Push Your Limits:** Give your body a reason to grow! Make sure you‚Äôre consistently challenging yourself in the gym.
    - **Turn Up the Heat:** If you've been stuck for over two weeks, bump up your intake by 100-150 calories to get the ball rolling again.

    ### Pace Your Protein
    - **Spread the Love:** Instead of cramming your protein into one or two giant meals, aim for 20-40 grams with each of your 3-4 daily meals. This works out to roughly 0.4-0.5 grams per kilogram of body weight per meal.
    - **Frame Your Fitness:** Get some carbs and 20‚Äì40g protein before and within two hours of wrapping up your workout.
    - **The Night Shift:** Try 20-30g of casein protein before bed for keeping your muscles fed while you snooze.

    ### Understanding Your Metabolism
    Your **Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)** is the energy your body needs just to keep the lights on. Your **Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)** builds on that baseline by factoring in how active you are throughout the day.

    ### The Smart Eater's Cheat Sheet
    Not all calories are created equal. Some foods fill you up, while others leave you rummaging through the pantry an hour later. Here‚Äôs the pecking order:
    - **Protein:** Protein is the undisputed king of fullness! It digests slowly, steadies blood sugar, and even burns a few extra calories in the process. Eggs, Greek yogurt, chicken, tofu, and lentils are all your hunger-busting best friends.
    - **Fiber-Rich Carbohydrates:** Veggies, fruits, and whole grains are the unsung heroes of fullness. They fill you up, slow things down, and bulk up meals without blowing your calorie budget.
    - **Healthy Fats:** Think of nuts, olive oil, and avocados as the smooth operators delivering steady, long-lasting energy that keeps you powered throughout the day.
    - **Processed Stuff:** These foods promise the world but leave you hanging. They're fine for a cameo appearance, but you can't build a winning strategy around them.
    - As a great rule of thumb, aim for **14 grams of fibre for every 1,000 calories** you consume, which usually lands between 25 and 38 grams daily. Ramp up gradually to avoid digestive drama.

    ### Your Nutritional Supporting Cast
    Going plant-based? There are a few tiny but mighty micronutrients to keep an eye on. They may not get top billing, but they‚Äôre essential for keeping the show running smoothly.
    - **The Watch List:**
        - **B‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇ:** B‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇ keeps your cells and nerves firing like a well-oiled machine. It‚Äôs almost exclusively found in animal products, so if you‚Äôre running a plant-powered show, you‚Äôll need reinforcements. A trusty supplement is often the easiest way to keep your levels topped up and your brain buzzing.
        - **Iron:** Iron is the taxi service that shuttles oxygen all over your body. When it‚Äôs running low, you‚Äôll feel like a sloth on a Monday morning. Load up on leafy greens, lentils, and fortified grains, and team them with a hit of vitamin C‚Äîthink bell peppers or citrus‚Äîto supercharge absorption.
        - **Calcium:** This multitasker helps build bones, power muscles, and keeps your heart thumping to a steady beat. While dairy is the classic go-to, you can also get your fix from kale, almonds, tofu, and fortified plant milks.
        - **Zinc:** Think of zinc as your immune system's personal security detail. You‚Äôll find it hanging out in nuts, seeds, and whole grains. Keep your zinc levels up, and you‚Äôll be dodging colds like a ninja.
        - **Iodine:** Your thyroid is the command center for your metabolism, and iodine is its right-hand mineral. A pinch of iodized salt is usually all it takes.
        - **Omega-3s (EPA/DHA):** These healthy fats are premium fuel for your brain, heart, and emotional well-being. If fish isn‚Äôt on your plate, fortified foods or supplements can help you stay sharp and serene.
    - The good news? Fortified foods and targeted supplements have your back. Plant milks, cereals, and nutritional yeast are often spiked with B‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇ, calcium, or iodine. Supplements are a safety net, but don‚Äôt overdo it. It‚Äôs always best to chat with a doctor or dietitian to build a plan that‚Äôs right for you.
